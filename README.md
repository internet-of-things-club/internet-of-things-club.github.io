# Inter-Club Name Exchange
**Before I talk about IoT Club**, I recognize that not everyone wants to do IoT and that there are alot of things one can do in the tech industry. I am proud to say that IoT Club is part of a semi-formal Inter-Club Name Exchange. What does this mean? It means that when you join IoT, you join **ALL** the other STEM clubs by assiocation. We will, on your behalf, advertise you the other clubs so that you may join and do projects with them. The following is the list of clubs in the semi-formal Inter-Club Name Exchange: 
- ACM (Associated Computing Machinary) (outreach and funding for non-club related projects)
- Computer Science Club (tech events, speakers, hackthons, etc)
- IoT Club (this is us!) (focuses on programming hardware)
- H[app]iness Development (web dev, app dev, game dev; less focus on hardware)
- KWAD Dawgs (quadrocopter club about flying and building quadracoptors)
- Trickfire Robotics (robotic competition club, they do the NASA Robotic Mining competiton every year)
- UWave, Clamor, Husky Hearld (these clubs need someone to do IT, make useful scripts to automate common / tedious computing tasks, maintain their website, etc)

## What is the Internet of Things (IoT)?
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things): 
>The Internet of things (IoT) is the network of physical devices, vehicles, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity which enable these objects to collect and exchange data. The IoT allows objects to be sensed or controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure, creating opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computer-based systems, and resulting in improved efficiency, accuracy and economic benefit in addition to reduced human intervention. "Things", in the IoT sense, can refer to a wide variety of devices...Legal scholars suggest regarding "things" as an "inextricable mixture of hardware, software, data and service".

Internet of Things is the idea that when you connect alot of computers to the Internet (sensors, cars, refrigerators, and the typical smartphone, laptop) you can start to do really cool things! This can range from making things "smart" like a doorknob that unlocks when you touch it to entire network of sensors collecting scientific data. Internet of Things also spills over into embedded systems and programming, mobile computing, cloud computing, robotics, edge computing, mesh networking, ubiquitous computing, ambient intelligence, and more!

## What is the Internet of Things (IoT) Club?
We envision IoT Club to be a hub for students interested in working with computer hardware, regardless of background. We want it to be _the_ place students meet to do computer hardware related projects, to learn how to use and program hardware, and to checkout equipment to do non-permanent prototyping. 

### Advisers
**Dr Yang Peng** is a professor of embedded systems and has great interest in this club. In fact, he has been trying to get a club like this started for years! 

**Rafael Silva** is a research engineer for the UWB. Like Dr Yang Peng, he is also has great interest in IoT Club and has an extensive background in it. In fact, he is the one leading the Smart Garden Project with the Garden Community at UWB! 

### The Only Rule of ~~Fight Club~~ IoT Club
If you agree to be apart of a project, you are **required** to be apart of that     project until all members of that project come to a mutual agreement that...
    - The project is finished
    - The project can be put on pause 
    - That your leaving the group will not cause any major disruptions 

Reasoning: 
_Everyone here is trying to use the stuff they do here to get a job._ Leaving a project part way and causing it to remain incomplete, means that everyone just wasted their time. Lets make sure time spent doing projects here actually produce something we can show on our resumes. 

### The Goals of IoT Club
1. Get you an internship 
2. Get you a project, that can be finished, that can be put on a resume, that can get you a internship
3. Build a community of hackers (people passionate about building stuff), that can do cool projects, that you can put on your resume, that can get you an internship 

### Meetings 
Every week we will meet for at least 1 hour to discuss general club things. These technically are not required, but are good opportunities to...
 - Meet each other 
 - Meet our advisor
 - Learn some skills
 - Find out what other projects are going on
 - Recruit people to join your projnct

### Projects

#### 2 Week Projects
Small, preferably self-contained projects. The goal is to do something quick and something specific. These short projects can compound into larger (i.e. 1 month) projects. 

#### 1 Month Projects
Wholelistic and complete (in most sense of that word) projects. The goal is to have something to be proud of and something that would *wow* potential employers. 

#### 1 Quarter Commitments
We recommend that, in addition to doing projects, members also join at least one 1 Quarter Commitments. This can be something minor such as agreeing to maintain a website for Clamor, something a bit more like helping the Trickfire Robotics team win a competition with your skills and talents, or something quite involved like doing undergradute research with a professor. 

### Hackathons and Events
We will also try to keep you all informed of hackthon, events, and anything else that might be interesting. We have tentitive plans of hosting our own hackthons.

## Finally...!
If you have an idea for a project or have a hackthon you need friends to go with or have a conference you think would be awesome to attend, TELL US! 

Feel free to email me `Donald Tran: dontran@uw.edu` or come to a meeting and share the idea with us! Also don't hestiate to contact me about anything else!

# Lets have a great year!
